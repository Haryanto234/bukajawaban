Flaky Test
----------
1. Flaky test is a test that sometimes fails, but after retry for a few times it passes eventually.
2. Use "wait" until the element shown
3. CAPTCHA is basically designed to prevent robot interaction with the application.
But if it's a must to automate the test for CAPTCHA, it can be done by asking developer team to build a workaround / backdoor for this.
For another solution, testing CAPTCHA can also be automated by recognizing the picture first, but this will take big efforts.
